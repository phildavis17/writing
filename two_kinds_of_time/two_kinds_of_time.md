## Qualitative Time
"What"
"Which"

Qualitative time is a measure of several interacting social, political, geographic, and astronomical processes.

examines the qualities of a given moment in time, things like Tuesdayness, or Februarity. 


There are 365 days in a year
A "day" is the amount of time it takes for the Earth to rotate once around.
A "year" is the amount of time it take for the Earth to complete one full orbit around the sun.
There is no reason why a 

Leap years happen every 4 years, except for years that are multiples of 100, which are not leap years, except for years that are multiples of 400, which _are_ leap years.
Furthermore, as a natural phenomenon, the rotation of the Earth is not perfectly consistent.
It varies slightly sometimes. 


## Timey-Wimey
In one hour, it will be one hour from now.
Right?
Well, it depends. 


What will the qualities of time be after one hour's worth of moments have elapsed?

Mixing moments and duration 


## Time Traveling
So what are we to do?
